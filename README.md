## Introduction
Welcome to the Awesome Modern PHP repository. This awesome list is a bit different than others - we are just interested in references which embraced not only PHP 8+, but are well maintained and looking for establishing new best practices while coding in PHP. We are looking for those who promoted PHP to the hall of modern programming languages, trying to extract the best for all new features it currently offers.

## Getting Started
- [PHP Official Documentation](https://www.php.net/docs.php)
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
- [PHP: The Right Way](https://phptherightway.com/)

## Frameworks
- [Laravel](https://laravel.com/)
- [Symfony](https://symfony.com/)
- [Zend Framework / Laminas](https://getlaminas.org/)

## Libraries

### Files
- [Penelope](https://github.com/cmatosbc/penelope): A high-performance asynchronous file handling library for PHP, leveraging Fibers for non-blocking I/O operations.

### Error Handling
- [Hephaestus](https://github.com/cmatosbc/hephaestus): Hephaestus provides a comprehensive set of tools for elegant error handling, combining functional programming concepts with robust exception management.

### Serialization
- [Pjson](https://github.com/square/pjson): This library helps deserializing JSON into actual objects of custom defined classes. It does so by using PHP8's attributes on class properties.

### Enums
- [PhpEnums](https://github.com/Elao/PhpEnums): Provides additional, opinionated features to the PHP 8.1+ native enums as well as specific integrations with frameworks and libraries.
